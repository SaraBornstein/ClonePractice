# 100 Day of Code with Grow with Google / Udacity Scholars

Round 3 for me, but rules are revised to participate in the Grow with Google version of this challenge.

## General Guidelines

These will be the general guidelines for this challenge within the Grow with Google Community:

- Scholars code for at least 30 minutes everyday.
- They will post a short announcement about their progress in the #motivation channel on Slack and note which day of the challenge they are on with a “D” followed by the day (e.g. D11 for day 11).
- Scholars will only count the days where they spent time on Labs and Projects (Udacity Assignments or Personal).
- Scholars will encourage and support at least two people each day in Slack(Can be participants in the challenge or in the Grow with Google Program in general)
- Scholars are allowed once skip day per two weeks. They cannot skip two days in a row. They will not count the day they skipped once they resume.
- The challenge must be completed by October 24th, 2018. Scholars can start whenever they wish to.

The #100DaysofCode Challenge accomplishes this by helping the scholar set a SMART goal.

Specific: Scholars are coding

Measurable: This goal is defined in a concrete amount of time(30 minutes)

Achievable: Everyone in phase 2 has already worked on some projects already

Realistic: Easily achievable given the amount of time that it takes to build these labs/projects

Time-Bound: This is a short term goal of 100 days
